# MLB-project

This folder contains files my teammates and I used to complete the MLB project. In this project, we focus on the relationship between attendence rate for each team and the team performance statistics. We web-scraped data from MLB website, aued alteryx and MySQl to do data cleansing and used Tableau to visualize data.
